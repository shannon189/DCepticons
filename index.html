					 an exciting and friendly environment. The challenge each year is to work as a team to construct
					  a robot that can be used in a competition. The DCepticons have been an FTC team for 3 years
						 now, and are becoming more experienced every day in the field of robotics.</p>-->

				<!--<p>in everything we do, the DCepticons are a very creative group with many talented members.
					We are able to put our heads together to find solutions to problems that we may come across.
					 The FTC challenge this year is a very difficult game called Res-Q. It involves scoring points by
					  picking up debris and putting it into various scoring zones of different heights. Higher scoring
						 zones are placed atop the "mountains" which the robot must climb. The most unique part of
						 our robot is the quad-wheel setup. The two front wheels are actually made of 8 smaller wheels
						  which will rotate and allow our robot to seamlessly roll over the bars on the mountains.</p>-->

					part in brings us great joy, as we love being able to give back to our very supportive community.
					 We took part in the Rotary Club meeting and some of us attended the Georgia International
					 Convention Center, where we were able to share many different parts of the robotics
					 experience with many others.We adore our different chances to really reach out and participate
					  in our community.</p>-->
