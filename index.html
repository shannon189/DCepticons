		<p>and we are team #7482 for the FIRST Tech Challenge. We come from Douglas County High School. Headed by our dedicated team leader, Shannon Myers, we aspire to do our very best regarding anything FTC. We work together as a tightly-knit, hard-working team in order to accomplish our goals.</p> </div>

		<h3 class="content-header">and we build robots...</h3>
		<p>for the FIRST Tech Challenge, a program that engages students into the various parts of a STEM field. It is an opportunity for them to interact with students who share similar interests in an exciting and friendly environment. The challenge each year is to work as a team to construct a robot that can be used in a competition. The DCepticons have been an FTC team for 3 years now, and are becoming more experienced every day in the field of robotics.</p>

		<h3 class="content-header">using unique ideas...</h3>
		<p>in everything we do, the DCepticons are a very creative group with many talented members. We are able to put our heads together to find solutions to problems that we may come across. The FTC challenge this year is a very difficult game called Res-Q. It involves scoring points by picking up debris and putting it into various scoring zones of different heights. Higher scoring zones are placed atop the "mountains" which the robot must climb. The most unique part of our robot is the quad-wheel setup. The two front wheels are actually made of 8 smaller wheels which will rotate and allow our robot to seamlessly roll over the bars on the mountains.</p> </div>

		<h3 class="content-header">while showcasing our work...</h3>
		<p>to the community. We have had numerous outreach opportunities and each one that we take part in brings us great joy, as we love being able to give back to our very supportive community. We took part in the Rotary Club meeting and some of us attended the Georgia International Convention Center, where we were able to share many different parts of the robotics experience with many others.We adore our different chances to really reach out and participate in our community.</p> </div>

		<div class = "size section-1">
		<h3 class="content-header">and helping other teams!</h3>
		<p>in many ways! One thing that we did was a Trunk Or Treat around Halloween. We built small robots for children to drive around, as well as gave out candy. The kids were very excited throughout the whole event and many of them were curious as to the workings of the robots. We were also the team that hosted the first competition of the season, the FTC Jungle Rumble, around Thanksgiving. It was a lot of hard work, but it paid off in the end as the competition went on just as planned and we were able to help out a ton of people. It was something that we all enjoyed, as we love being able to assist others in any way possible.
